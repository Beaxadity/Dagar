1
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,880
What were you looking at?

2
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,240
Huh?

3
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,520
What were you looking at?

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,800
Huh? Where,.... when?

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,240
What were you looking at out there?

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,160
Nothing

7
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,000
Were you crying?

8
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,800
Crying? No

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,280
Were you crying over the photo album?

10
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
No, I wasn't crying

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,960
She would have betrayed you anyway...

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,320
Not all is what it seems when it
