1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,480
Do you have a driver's license?

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,160
I think so...

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,480
Well

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,440
Jon from Arnarfjord

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,240
Huh?

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,720
Don't you remember me?

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,840
Sven?

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,080
Sven from Sugandafjord like I was sometimes called

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,000
We sometimes met up between 
fishing tours back in the day

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,760
Umm...

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,920
You were dating a girl from Flateyri

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,920
Wait, no, she was from Patro

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,440
Jon from Arnarfjord

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,880
Don’t you remember me?

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,040
Sven?

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,040
Sven from Sugundafjord

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,800
We sometimes met up between fishing tours back in the day

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,120
You were dating some girl from Patro

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
What was her name again?

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
Berg-something

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,120
Bergrun or Bergljot

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,000
Hah

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,280
Jon from Arnarfjord

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,880
Well

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,080
Isn't that your mother?

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,480
Yep

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello there ma'am

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,120
You remember me...?

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,600
And...

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
Where are you headed?

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,240
South

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,160
To Reykjavik?

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,040
Eyrarbakki

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,560
Eyrarbakki?

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,480
Got any relatives there?

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,840
My mom

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Your mom has relatives there

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:54,960
Yes

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,600
How long are you staying?

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,800
She is going to rest there

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,240
Is that so?

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,760
Do they have a sanatorium in Eyrarbakki?

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,280
What?

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
Like a temporary rest-stay place, right?

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,400
She doesn't need a rest-stay, she's dead

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,280
Yes

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Look, Jon...

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,840
So...

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,880
Your driver's license is getting a little worn

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,920
And I have to encourage you to to have 
the car inspected at your earliest convenience

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
Preferably at a car repair shop

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,840
I really should ground your car 
right here and now, but...

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,440
But for old times sake

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
And not to mention your mother

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
I'm going to give you 
an opportunity to rectify this

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,320
Okay?

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,160
Yeah and umm...

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
I don't say this very often, but

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,920
Drive a little faster

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Or just use less frequently used roads

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,400
That may be best for you

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:54,920
Huh?

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,880
Are you...

65
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,760
Are you going to watch the comet tonight?

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,480
It's going to be spectacular

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,760
Okay, Jon

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,040
Safe travels, my friend
