1
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,400
Hey.

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,160
Come.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,840
Fucking hell, man.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,800
Where did you learn to drive, huh?!

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,040
Hey man...
What's wrong with you, huh?!

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,600
No need to get violent.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
Violent?!

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,000
How is one supposed to react to...

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,160
Attempted murder, huh?

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,920
Attempted murder?!
Yeah.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,760
Fucking hell, man.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,440
What are you thinking, man?!

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
You're endagering everyone here!

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,320
This is completely ridiculous, man!

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,200
What's wrong with you?!

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,760
Ugh!

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
New Caption

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,360
Good morning.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,120
Good morning.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
What's going on?

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,360
Ask this maniac!

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
He's endagering everyone here!

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,960
Drives around at 30km an hour...

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,560
(stuttering) on... on... on...

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
Hold your horses,

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,320
and come with me over here for a second.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,000
New Caption

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,240
Am I being arrested for trying to...

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,280
promote some minimal traffic conduct?

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,840
Take it easy.
Because of this idiot?

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,160
This maniac?

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,880
Take it easy.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
No one is being arrested.

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,840
Just come over and talk to me.

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,560
Well now, how are you doing?

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm doing fine.

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,360
That's quite the row of cars behind you.

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,640
Yep.

39
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,240
What are we talking about here?

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,320
The row of cars behind me...

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,200
At what speed were you driving?

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,960
The speedometer showed forty two.

43
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,280
That wouldn't excactly be called speeding, would it?

44
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,840
Nope.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:45,960
No...

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,000
This won't work.

47
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,440
You can't drive so slow.

48
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,200
You are causing a lot of danger in traffic.

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,720
It's really dangerous.

50
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,280
Do you have a driver's license?

51
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,720
Yeah, I...

52
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,520
think so...

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,640
Well well,

54
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
if it isn't Jon from Arnarfjord.

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
Isn't it Jon from Arn...

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,240
Don't you remember me?

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,920
Sven?

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,880
Sven from Sugandafjord.

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
We sometimes met up between finshing tours back in the day.

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,880
I'm sure it's been thirty or forty years.

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,800
You were dating a girl from Patro.

62
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,920
Berg-something was her name. 

63
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,680
Berg... Berg... Bergljot... Bergrun.

64
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,520
Heh, Jon from Arnarfjord.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Is that your mother?

66
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,640
Yep.

67
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,440
Hello ther, ma'am.

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
You remember me...?

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Where are you headed?

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,720
South.

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,760
Into town?

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,720
Eyrarbakki.

73
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,360
Eyrarbakki?
Yeah.

74
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,520
Got relatives there?

75
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,880
My mom.

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Your mom has relatives there?

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Yes.

78
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,440
Okay... Plan on staying long?

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,600
Well...

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,600
She is going to...

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,560
rest there.

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,360
Mmm...

83
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,760
Do they have a sanatorium there?

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,400
Huh?

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,160
Yes, like a temporary rest-stay place.

86
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,680
She doesn't need to rest.

87
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,440
She's dead.

88
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,720
Hey Jon...

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,960
Your driver's license is getting a little worn.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,240
And I have to encourage you to have the car inspected at your earliest convenience.

91
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
Preferably at a repair shop.

92
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,000
You see...

93
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 I really should ground your car right here and now...

94
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
but... you know, for old times sake, 

95
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,480
and especially because of your mother...

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,040
I'm going to give you a chance to rectify this.

97
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,640
Okay?

98
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Mhmm.

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:45,960
Well...

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,160
I think it would be best for you to...

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,800
take less frequently used roads.

102
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,160
And... I haven't said this before,

103
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,200
but for the love of god, drive a little faster.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Oh, are you going to watch the...

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,960
comet tonight?

106
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,680
It's going to be spectacular...

107
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
Okay then... Safe travels...

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,560
Maniac.
