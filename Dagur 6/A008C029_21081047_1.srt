1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,920
I'm going to Bjarkarlundur.

2
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,560
What?

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,320
Bjarkarlundur.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,240
We're headed south. Is there something wrong?

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:38,960
Sorry?

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,000
Why were you waving at us to stop?

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,680
I don't speak Icelandic.

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,440
We Icelandic.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,480
She okay?

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
She's dead.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,320
Okay.
