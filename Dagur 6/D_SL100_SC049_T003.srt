00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,360
Hello.

2
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm going to Bjarkarlundur.

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,520
What?

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,000
Bjarkarlundur.

5
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,480
Hello.

6
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,960
I'm going to Bjarkarlundur.

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,720
Bjarkarlundur.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,680
We're heading south. Is there something wrong?

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,680
Sorry?

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,240
Why were you waving at us to stop?

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
I don't speak Icelandic.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,320
Uh we...

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,880
Icelandic.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Is she okay?

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,920
She's dead.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,240
Ah okay.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,000
Ah you maybe...

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,040
No problem.
