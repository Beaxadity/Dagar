1
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,200
What were you looking at?

2
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,480
Huh?

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,320
What were you looking at?

4
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,920
What were you looking at?

5
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,880
Huh?

6
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
What were you looking at?

7
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,680
Huh?

8
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,560
Where,.... when?

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,320
What were you looking at out there?

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,760
Nothing

11
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,680
Were you crying?

12
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Crying? No, of course I wasn't
crying

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,840
Were you crying over the photo album?

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,360
No

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,440
She would have betrayed you anyway...

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,680
Not all is what it seems when it
comes to Comrade Kosygin.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,240
Huh?

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,160
Brezhnev?
