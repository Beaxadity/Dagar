1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,800
Hey.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,720
Come out.

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,160
Come out!

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,280
Where the hell did you learn to drive, man?

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,160
Listen, no need to get violent.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,840
Violent?

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,720
Huh?
Yes.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,240
 How is one supposed to react to attempted murder, huh?

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,520
Attempted murder?
Yes.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,560
What are you thinking, man?

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,200
You endangered everyone here.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,960
Only thinking about your own ass, huh?

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Complete fucking ass...

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,600
Hello.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Alright...

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,440
What is going on here?

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,160
Why don't you ask this neanderthal?

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,720
He's been putting us all in danger by...

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,160
Driving around at 30km an hour on the highway.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,880
Hold your horses.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,600
Come talk to me for a second.
What are you doing?

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,360
Am I being arrested...

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,160
for trying to promote some minimal traffic conduct?

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,320
No one is being arrested.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,600
Just come and talk to me for a second.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,680
Fucking...

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,520
Shit.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,160
Well now...

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,520
how are we doing?

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,160
I'm doing fine.

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,240
That was quite the row of cars behind you.

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,800
Yep.

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,560
What are we talking about here?

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
The row of cars behind me...

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,320
At what speed were you driving?

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,920
The speedometer showed forty two.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,160
Mmm...

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,800
That wouldn't exactly be called speeding.

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,560
Nope.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,280
No...

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,800
Listen...

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,320
That's unfortunately much too slow...

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,080
for the highway.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,520
You're creating a lot of danger.

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,680
Do you have a driver's license?

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,600
Yes. I think so...

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,360
Ha!

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,880
Well well...

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,600
If it isn't Jon from Arnarfjord.

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,440
Don't you remember me?

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,320
Sven?

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Sven from Sugangafjord like I was sometimes called?

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,880
We sometimes met up between fishing tours back in the day.

54
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm sure it's been thirty or forty years.

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,920
You were dating a girl from Patro.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,440
What was her name again?

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,760
Berg-something...

58
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,400
Bergljot or... Bergrun...

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
New Caption

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,440
Is that your mother?

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Yep.

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,080
Hello there, ma'am.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,080
You remember me...?

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,160
Mmm...

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,120
Where are you headed?

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,680
South.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,840
Into town?

68
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,520
Eyrarbrakki.

69
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,040
Eyrarbakki?

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
Got relatives there?

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,160
My mom.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,680
Your mom has relatives there?

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,280
Okay...

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,520
Plan on staying long?

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,880
Mom is going to rest there.

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,760
Okay...

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,080
Do they have a sanatorium there?

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,840
Huh?

80
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
Yes, like a temporary rest-stay place.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
She doesn't need to rest. She...

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,280
She doesn't need to rest. She's dead.

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,440
Uh, Jon...

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Your driver's license is getting a little worn.

85
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,280
And I have to encourage you to have the car inspected...

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
at your earliest convenience.

87
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
Or maybe even just go to a repair shop.

88
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,560
I really should ground your car right here and now,

89
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,320
but... you know, for old times sake

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,920
and especially because of your mother...

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm going to give you an opportunity to rectify this.

92
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,360
Alright?

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,880
And I...

94
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,320
don't say this ver often, but...

95
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,320
for Gods sake drive a little faster.

96
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Or...

97
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,200
or just take...

98
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,720
less frequently used roads.

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
I think that would be best for you...

100
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,120
Are you going to...

101
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,960
watch the com...

102
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
the comet tonight.

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,760
It's going to be spectacular...

104
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,320
Okay then... Safe travels...
