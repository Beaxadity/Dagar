1
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm going to Bjarkarlundur.

2
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,760
What?

3
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,800
Bjarkarlundur?

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,680
We're headed south.

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,000
Is there something wrong?

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,920
Sorry?

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,160
Why were you waving at us to stop?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,240
I don't speak Icelandic.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,440
Ahhh... We...

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,880
We Icelandic.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,280
She okay?

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,960
She's dead.

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Maybe uhh...
