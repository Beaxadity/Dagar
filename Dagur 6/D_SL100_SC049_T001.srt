00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,520
I'm going to Bjarkarlundur.

2
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,480
What?

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Bjarkarlundur.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,920
We are heading south.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,120
Is there something wrong?

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,120
Sorry?

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,320
Why were you waving at us to stop?

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,320
I don't speak Icelandic.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,600
Uh... we...

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,640
We Icelandic.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,320
She okay?

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,200
She's dead.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,080
Okay... you're maybe uhh...

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,520
Thank you!

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,480
No problem.
