1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Do you have your driver's license?

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah...

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,240
I think so...

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,520
Well, well

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
If it isn't Jon from Arnarfjord

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,840
Don't you remember me

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,760
Sven?

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,480
Sven from Sugandafjord

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,720
Umm...

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,920
We sometimes met up 
between fishing tours back in the day

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,240
You were dating...

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,200
Some girl from Patreksfjord

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,360
What was her name again?

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,720
Berg-something

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,240
Bergrun or Bergljot

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,080
Jon from Arnarfjord

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,320
That's your mother, right?

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,600
Yep

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,560
Hello there, ma'am

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,880
You remember
me...?

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,520
Hmm...

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,560
And what...

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,880
Where are you headed?

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,360
South

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,560
To Reykjavik?

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,400
Eyrarbakki

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,080
Mmm...

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
Eyrarbakki? Got relatives there?

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:25,880
My mom

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Your mom has relatives there?

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,160
Yes

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:29,800
Huh

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,360
Plan on staying long?

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,680
Mom is going to rest there

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:34,880
What...

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
Do they have a sanatorium there?

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Huh?

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,320
Yes, like a temporary rest-stay place

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,240
She doesn't need rest, she's dead.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,320
Uh... Jon

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Your driver's license
 is getting a little worn

42
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
And I have to encourage you to have the car
inspected at your earliest convenience

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,240
Or just go to the next car repair shop

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,800
I really should ground your car right here and now

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,080
But you know, for old times sake

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,120
And not to mention your mother

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm going to give you an opportunity

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,640
To rectify this

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,960
I don't say this very often, but

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,640
Try to drive a little faster

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,040
Or take the local gravel roads, 
that may be best for you

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,320
Okay?

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,080
Hey, are you...

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,160
Going to watch the comet tonight?

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,480
It's going to be spectacular....

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,000
Safe travels, Jon
