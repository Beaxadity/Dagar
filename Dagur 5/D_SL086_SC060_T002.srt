1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,040
Do you have your driver's license?

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,560
Yeah, I think so...

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,280
Well well

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,240
Jon from Arnarfjord?

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,760
Don't you remember me?

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,280
Sven?

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,000
Sven from Sugandafjord

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,680
We sometimes met up 
between fishing tours back in the day.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,680
Umm...

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,720
You were dating a girl from patro

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,080
What was her name again?

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,560
Berg-something, Bergrun or Bergljot

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,320
Jon from Arnarfjord

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,920
That's your mother, right?

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,280
Yep

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,760
Hello there, ma'am. You remember
me...? 

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,080
Hmm?

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,320
Where are you headed?

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,840
South

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,320
To Reykjavik?

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,640
Eyrarbakki

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,200
Eyrarbakki?

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,120
Got relatives there?

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,600
My mom

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,720
Your mom has relatives there?

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,040
Yes

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,760
I see

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,280
Plan on staying long?

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,560
Mom is going to rest there

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,160
Do they have a sanatorium there?

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,720
Huh?

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,440
Yes, like a temporary rest-stay place

33
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,520
She doesn't rest, she's dead

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,480
Uh.. Jon

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
New Caption

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,280
And I have to encourage you to have 
the car inspected at your earliest convenience.

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,840
Or just go to the next car repair shop

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,560
I really should... 

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,600
Ground your car right here and now

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,200
Yes

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,480
But you know, for old times sake,

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
Especially because of your mother

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm going to give you an opportunity to rectify this

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay?

45
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,760
Well

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,040
I don't say this very often

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,680
Try to drive a little faster

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,280
Or take the less frequently used roads

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,720
That might be best for you?

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:20,960
Hey

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Aren't you...

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Going to watch the comet tonight?

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,440
It's going to be spectacular

54
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:28,960
Okay then....

55
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,240
Bye Jon. Safe travels
