1
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm going to Bjarkarlundur.

2
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,240
What?

3
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,520
Bjarkarlundur.

4
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
We're heading south.

5
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,320
Is there something wrong?

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,440
Excuse me?

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,320
Why were you waving at us to stop?

8
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,120
No speak Icelandic.

9
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
We Icelandic.

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,040
Is she okay?

11
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,920
She's dead.

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,120
Ah you maybe...

13
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,840
Thank you!

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,880
No problem.
