1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,560
Damn it.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,640
Hey.

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,640
Come out.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,200
Come out.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,520
What are you thinking, huh?

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,840
Where the hell did you learn to drive, man?

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,160
Listen, no need to get violent.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,200
Violent?

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,000
How is one supposed to react to attempted murder, huh?

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,320
Attempted murder?

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,400
What are you thinking, huh?

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,680
You're endagering everybody here.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,920
What are you doing?

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,080
You complete fucking idiot.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,440
Good morning.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,800
What is going on here?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,640
Why don't you ask this neanderthal?

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,200
He's been putting us all in danger by

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,200
driving at 30km an hour on the highway.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Calm down please.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,160
I am calm.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,560
Come with me.

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,720
Am I being arrested?

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,400
For trying to promote some minimal traffic conduct, huh?

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,360
Take it easy, buddy. No one is being arrested.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,400
Come and talk to me.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,600
Shit.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Shit!

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,640
Well now...

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:23,920
how are we doing?

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,840
That was quite the row of cars behind you.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,360
Yep.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,120
What are we talking about here?

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,320
The row of cars behind me...

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,000
At what speed were you driving?

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,840
The speedometer showed forty two.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,920
That wouldn't exactly be called speeding.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,400
Nope.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,960
Listen...

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,240
That's unfortunately much too slow for the highway.

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,960
You're creating danger by driving so slow.

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
Do you have a driver's license?

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,040
Yes, I think so...

45
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,120
Well well,

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,160
Jon from Arnarfjord...

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
If it isn't Jon from Arnarfjord.

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Don't you remember me?

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,880
Sven?

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,160
Sven from Sugandafjord like I was sometimes called?

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,400
We sometimes met up...

52
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,680
between fishing tours back in the day.

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
I'm sure it's been thirty or forty years.

54
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,120
You...

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,040
You were dating...

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,920
some girl from Patro.

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,880
What was her name again?

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,440
Berg-something...

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,640
Berg... Berg... run or... Bergljot.

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
Jon from Arnarfjord?

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,960
Is that your mother?

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,640
Yep.

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,600
Hello there, ma'am.

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,280
You remember me...?

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,480
And...

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Where are you headed?

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,280
South.

68
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,720
Into town?

69
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,360
Eyrarbakki.

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,040
Eyrarbakki?

71
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,080
Got relatives there?

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,520
My mom.

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Your mom got relative there?

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,280
Mhmm.

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,560
Okay...

76
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,560
Plan on staying long?

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,000
Mom is going to rest there.

78
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,120
Do they have a sanatorium there?

79
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,840
Huh?

80
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,680
Yes, like a temporary rest-stay place.

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,160
She doesn't need rest. She's dead.

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,920
Uh, Jon...

83
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,080
Your driver's license is getting a little worn.

84
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,920
And I have to encourage you to have the car inspected at your earliest convenience.

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,560
Or maybe go straight to a repair shop.

86
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,280
 I really should ground your car right here and now.

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,320
But... you know, for old times sake...

88
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,080
and especially because of your mother.

89
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm going to give you an opportunity to rectify this.

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Alright?

91
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,360
Yes.

92
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,640
Yeah and, well I...

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,000
don't say this very often, but...

94
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,800
for God's sake, drive a little faster.

95
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,480
Or use less frequently used roads...

96
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,840
I think that would be best for you.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay...

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,320
Oh, are you going to watch...

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,640
the comet tonight.

100
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
It's going to be spectacular...

101
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
Okay then... Safe travels...

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,160
Maniac.
