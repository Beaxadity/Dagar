1
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,520
What were you looking at?

2
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,640
Huh?

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,720
What were you looking at?

4
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
Huh? Where,.... when?

5
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,920
What were you looking at out there?

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,400
Nothing

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,120
Were you crying?

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,640
Crying? No, of course I wasn't
crying

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,440
Were you crying over the photo album?

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,760
Nope

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,320
She would have betrayed you anyway...

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,360
Not all is what it seems when it
comes to Comrade Kosygin.

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:25,800
Hmm?

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,360
Wouldn't you agree?

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,880
Yeah
