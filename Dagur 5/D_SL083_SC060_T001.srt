1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,320
Fucking hell!

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,360
Get out!

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,480
Get out!

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,240
Fuck!

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,200
Where the hell did you learn to drive, man?

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,640
What?

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,840
What's going on!

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,640
Violent?!

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,000
Huh?

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,720
How is one supposed to
react to attempted murder? Huh?

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,120
Attempted murder?

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,480
Yes!

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,400
What were you going to do?

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,520
Kill us all?

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:39,840
Huh?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,440
Are you f...

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,120
Absolutely retarded?!

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,680
Huh?

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,160
What were you thinking?

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:57,800
What?

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,080
What is going on here?

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,720
Why don't you ask this neanderthal? Huh?

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,680
He's putting us all in danger by 
driving at 30km an hour!

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,920
Hold your horses

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,800
Relax

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,400
Relax?

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,400
Why don't you come with
me over here for a second?

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,920
Am i being arrested for trying to 
promote some minimal traffic conduct?

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,960
Take it easy, buddy. No one is being arrested

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,680
Come here and talk to me for a second

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,640
You are a complete idiot!

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
Well now, how are we doing?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm doing fine

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,000
What uh...

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,880
That was quite the row of cars behind you

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,360
Yep

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,440
What are we talking about here?

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,320
The row of cars behind me...

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,720
At what speed were you going?

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
The speedometer showed forty two

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,960
That wouldn't exactly be...

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
Called speeding

43
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,480
Nope

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,760
Listen, that's unfortunately much too slow

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
You're creating danger in the traffic

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,360
Do you have a driver's license?

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,600
Yeah, I think so...

48
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,240
Uh, hah

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
Jo- Jon, Jon from Arnarfjord is it really you?

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,760
Don't you remember me?

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,320
Sven?

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,160
Sven from Sugandafjord

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,400
We sometimes met up between fishing tours back in the day

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm sure it's been thirty to forty years since

55
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,880
You were dating some girl from Patro

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,080
What was her name again? Berg-something. Bergljot or Bergrun

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
That's your mother, right?

58
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:41,800
Yep

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
Hello there, ma'am. You remember me...?

60
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Where are you headed?

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,240
South

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,680
To Reykjavik?

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,520
Eyrarbakki

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,280
What?

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,280
Got relatives in Eyrarbakki?

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,800
My mom

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Your mom has relatives there?

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,040
Yes

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:02,720
Yeah?

70
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,640
And how long do you plan to stay?

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,120
Uh

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
Mom is going to rest there

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,680
Do they have a sanatorium there?

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,440
What?

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,320
Yes, like a temporary rest-stay place?

76
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,280
She doesn't need to rest, she's dead

77
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,320
Uh... Jon

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,200
Your driver's license is getting a little worn

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
And I have to encourage you to have 
the car inspected as soon as possible

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,480
Or even just go to the next car repair shop

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
I really should ground your car right here and now

82
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
But you know, for old times sake

83
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm going to give you an opportunity to rectify this, okay?

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,400
Especially because of your mother

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,000
Well...

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,240
I don't say this often, but...

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
Try to drive a little faster

88
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,480
Or maybe

89
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Use less frequently used roads, 
that may be best for you

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,120
Okay?

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,160
Yep

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,920
Hey, are you...

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,720
Are you going to watch the comet tonight?

94
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,240
It'll be spectacular

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,520
Safe travels

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,720
Yes

97
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,640
Maniac!
