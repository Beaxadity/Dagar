1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,840
Fucking hell...

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,520
Hey!

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,440
Come out.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,080
Fucking hell...

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,520
Hey!

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,400
Where the hell did you learn to drive, man? Huh...?

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,120
What's wrong with you, huh?

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,520
Listen, no need to get violent.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,840
Violent?

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,520
Huh...?

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,080
How is one supposed to react to attempted murder, huh?

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,880
Attempted murder?
Idio...

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,840
What are you doing, huh?

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,600
You're endagering everyone.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
Are you... are you... completely...

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
a complete idiot.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,280
What are you thinking, huh?

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,520
Good morning.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,080
Is everybody calm?

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,280
What is going on here?

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,920
Why don't you ask this maniac?

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,560
He's benn putting us all in danger.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,880
Drives around at 30km an hour like some idiot.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Alright, calm down.

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,160
I am calm.

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,160
Okay, come talk to me for a second.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,800
Hey, am I being arrested for trying to...

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,440
promote some minimal traffic conduct?

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,120
Buddy, no one is being arrested.

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,200
Just come and talk to me...

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,120
Stop it.

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,080
Well now...

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,520
how are we doing?

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm doing fine.

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,360
That was quite the row of cars behind you.

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,840
Yep.

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,080
What are we talking about here?

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,880
The row of cars behind me...

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,880
At what speed were you driving?

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,280
The speedometer showed forty two.

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,440
That wouldn't exactly be called speeding.

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,040
Nope.

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,520
No...

44
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,600
Listen, that's way too slow...

45
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,400
You can't drive so slowon a highway, it creates so much danger.

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,640
Do you hav a driver's license?

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Uhm...

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,560
Yes, I think so...

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,480
Well, well...

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,000
Jon...

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
If it isn't Jon from Arnarfjord.

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,320
Don't you remember me?

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,360
Sven.

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Sven from Sugandafjord like I was sometimes called?

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
We sometimes met up between fishing tours back in the day.

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm sure it's been thirty or forty years.

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
You were dating...

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,280
a girl from...

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,240
Patro.

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,880
What was her name again?

61
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,400
Berg-something... Bergljot or Bergrun...

62
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,800
Is that your mother?

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,200
Yep.

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
Hello there, ma'am.

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
You remember me...?

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,840
Where are you headed?

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,640
South.

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,040
Into town?

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,000
No, Eyrarbakki.

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Ey... Eyrarbakki?

71
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
Got relatives there?

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,480
My mom.

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Your mom has relatives there?

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Yes.

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,480
Mmm...

76
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
Plan on staying long?

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Mom is going to rest there.

78
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,960
Do they have a sanatorium there?

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,680
Huh?

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,760
Yes, like a temporary rest-stay place.

81
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
She doesn't need to rest. She's dead.

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,720
Uh, Jon...

83
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,760
You're driver's license is getting a little worn.

84
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,720
And I have to encourage you to have the car inspected at your earliest convenience.

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Or just straight to a repair shop.

86
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 I really should ground your car right here and now...

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,880
but... you know, for old times sake,

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
and especially because of your mother...

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
 I'm going to give you an opportunity to rectify this, alright?

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:40,960
Hey.

91
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't say this very often...

92
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,960
but for god's sake, drive a little faster.

93
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,240
Or try to take less frequently used roads.

94
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
That would probably be best for you.

95
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
Oh, are you going to watch...

96
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
the comet tonight...

97
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,040
It's going to be spectacular...

98
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,520
Safe travels...
