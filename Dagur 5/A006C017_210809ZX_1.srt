1
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,160
Do you have a driver's license?

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,720
Yeah, I think so

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,200
Hah

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,800
Jon from Arnarfjord

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,640
Don't you remember me?

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,840
Sven?

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,400
Sven from Sugandafjord

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
We sometime met up between 
fishing tours back in the day

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,680
You were dating some girl from Patro

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,720
What was her name again?

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,720
Berg-something, Bergrun or Bergljot

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,200
Hah

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,120
Jon from Arnarfjord

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,760
Ah

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Is rhat your mother?

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,480
Yep

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,120
Hello there, ma'am

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,760
You might remember me?

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:25,840
Oh

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
Where are you headed?

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,800
South

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,560
To Reykjavik?

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,280
Eyrarbakki

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,400
Aah, do you have any relatives in Eyrarbakki?

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:35,760
My mom

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,040
Your mom has relatives there?

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,320
Yes

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,000
Hmm

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,400
Plan on staying long?

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,480
She is going to rest there

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,120
What

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,280
Do they have a sanatorium in Eyrarbakki?

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,280
What?

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,520
Like a temporary rest-stay place

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
She doesn't need to rest, she's dead

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,960
Listen... Jon

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,960
Your driver's license is getting a little worn

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,800
And I have to encourage you to have 
the car inspected as soon as possible

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,920
You should really just go to the next car repair shop

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,040
I really should ground your car right here and now

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,200
But because of old times sakes

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,240
And not to mention your mother, I'm going to

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,800
Give you an opportunity to...

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,800
Rectify this

45
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,960
I don't say this very often, but

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,720
Try to drive a little faster

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,960
 Or take the less frequently used roads

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,120
I think that might be best for you

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,600
Okay?

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Oh, yeah, 

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
Are you going to watch the comet tonight?

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,760
It's going to be spectacular

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,560
Safe travels
