1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,040
Shit!

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,640
Hey!

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,360
Come here!

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,680
Come out here!

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,360
Fucking hell!

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
Where the hell did you learn to
drive, man?

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,360
Hey, buddy

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,040
Where the hell did you learn to 
drive, man?

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,720
 Listen, no need to get violent

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,320
Violent?!

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,320
Huh?

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,600
 How is one supposed to react
to attempted murder, huh?

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,600
Attempted murder?

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,040
What are you thinking? Are you intentionally trying to cause
a mass accident? Huh?

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,120
Shit!

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,080
Good day

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,320
What's going on here?

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,080
Why don't you ask this neanderthal?

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,800
He's been putting us all in danger by
driving at 30km an hour on the
highway.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,480
Why don't you come
with me over here for a second?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,520
Stop it!

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,520
Hey!

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,160
Come with me!

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,560
Am I being arrested for trying to
promote some minimal traffic conduct? 

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,040
Take is easy, buddy. No one is being
arrested

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,720
Watch out! 

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,240
Jesus!

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,040
Well now

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,280
How are we doing?

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm doing fine

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,800
That was quite the row of cars behind
you

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,160
Yep

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,920
What are we talking about here?

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,560
"The row of cars behind me...."

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,120
At what speed were you driving?

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
The speedometer showed forty two

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,440
That wouldn't exactly be called
speeding

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,880
Nope

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,360
Hmm...

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,680
Listen, that's unfortunately much too
slow for the highway

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,960
You're
creating danger by driving so
slow

42
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
Do you have a driver's license?

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah, I think so...

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,360
Well well

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,880
Jon? Jon from Arnarfjord? 

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,280
Hah

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,600
Jon from Arnarfjord, don't you remember me?

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,960
Sven

49
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,440
Sven from Sugandafjord like I was
sometimes called?

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,800
We sometimes met up between fishing
tours back in the day

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm sure it's been thirty or forty years

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,200
See, you were dating a...

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
Girl from Patreksfjord

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
What was her name again? 

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,480
Berg-something. Bergthora or Bergrun.

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,360
Hah, Jon from Arnarfjord

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
That's your mother, right?

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,520
Yep

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Hello there, ma'am

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,520
You remember
me...?

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,200
And, where are you headed?

62
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,720
South

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,360
To Reykjavik?

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,120
Eyrarbakki

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
Eyrarbakki? Got relatives there?

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,480
My mom

67
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,120
Your mom has relatives there?

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,360
Yes

69
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,880
Hmm...

70
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,720
Plan on staying long? 

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,920
Mom is going to rest there

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,760
Do they have a sanatorium there?

73
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,680
She doesn't need a rest, she's
dead

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,440
No, of course not

75
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,520
Uh.. Jon

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,520
Your driver's license is
getting a little worn

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,560
And I have to encourage you to have the car
inspected at your earliest convenience

78
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,440
Or just the next car repair shop

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,120
I really should...

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,880
Ground your car right
here and now, but...

81
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,360
You know, for
old times sake

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,200
And not to mention your mother

83
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm going to give you
an opportunity to rectify this, alright

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,480
Okay

85
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,240
I don't say this very often, but in

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,480
Gods name, drive a little faster

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Or take the local gravel roads

88
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,240
Wouldn't that work better for you?

89
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Oh, are you...

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you going to
watch the comet tonight?

91
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,040
It's going to be spectacular

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,760
Safe travels Jon

93
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,680
Maniac!
